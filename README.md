# Fitness-Equipment-Dataset-Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of a fitness equipment dataset aimed at understanding profitability trends, supplier contributions, and category-wise performance. The dataset spans multiple years and includes key metrics such as monthly profits, year-to-date profits, cumulative data, and percentage metrics for various product categories and suppliers.

  ### **Project Overview**

This project provides insights into:

  * Profitability trends by category (e.g., Elliptical, Resistance Bands, Yoga Mats).

  * Supplier performance across different brands.

  * Year-over-year (YoY) changes in profit contributions.

  * Visualizations to highlight trends and actionable insights.

  * Inspired by one of the "Mo Chance" videos but modified with custom cumulative metrics for better trend analysis.

**Profit Comparison by Category**

  * High-level profit comparison across categories.

  * Includes a bar chart for visualizing category-wise profit contributions.

**Master_Data**

  * Comprehensive dataset with raw and processed data.

  * Includes details such as "Profit (Month)," "Profit YTD," and new columns "Cumulative Total Profit," "Total Profit," and "Cumulative Profit %."

  * Allows for detailed exploration of long-term performance trends.

**Sales_Data**

  * Tracks annual profit percentage changes for categories and suppliers from 2018 to 2024.

  * Useful for identifying growth and decline trends over time.

**Processed_Data**

  * Aggregated data used for trend analysis and visualizations.

  * Includes line charts comparing brand-wise monthly profits.

### **New Metrics Explanation**

  * **Cumulative Total Profit:** Summation of profits over time to reflect overall trends and growth.

  * **Total Profit:** Summarized profits for specific categories, suppliers, or time frames.

  * **Cumulative Profit %:** Percentage representation of cumulative profits relative to total profits, providing insights into proportional growth over time.

**Visualizations**

  * Bar charts for category-wise profit analysis.

  * Line charts showcasing long-term performance trends for brands and categories.

**Insights and Recommendations**

  * Categories like "Resistance Bands" and "Rowing Equipment" are top performers.
